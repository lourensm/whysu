python main.py

Program solves at least one sudoku puzzle.
Sudoku variant with additional constraints of 4  3x3 squares.

Inspired by recent publicity on Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong.

I followed the same procedure I use when solving it on paper.
I wondered what rules are sufficient to solve a sudoku and avoided
using additional datastructures that I do not visualize in my "on paper"
procedure.

No exhaustive testing done, rules could be insufficient.
